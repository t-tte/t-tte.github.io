Welcome to my updated website! Here you'll find up to date links to my research papers and other interesting resources mostly related to causal inference. I'm also planning to blog on topics such as data science, causal inference, machine learning and endurance sports - preferably all of them at the same time! If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to message me on any of the social media accounts you can see on the left hand side. Thanks for reading, and speak soon!
