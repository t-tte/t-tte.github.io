I'm a data scientist with a special interest in the intersection of experimentation, causal inference and machine learning. These interests come together in the [Causal ML](https://github.com/uber/causalml) library that I've coauthored as a part of the core development team. For an overview of some of my other work in the area of causal inference, I recommend checking out [this Uber Eng blog post](https://eng.uber.com/causal-inference-at-uber/). Professionally, my passion is to combine abstract theoretical ideas with practical implementations to achieve a positive impact in the world. Outside of work, I like to spend time on my bike in the nature, preferably in the mountains.
